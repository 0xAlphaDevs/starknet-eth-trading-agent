### Attack Vectors

- **Front-running** : Mitigated by using Starknet's high throughput and low latency.
- **Smart Contract Exploits** : Regular audits and adherence to best practices in smart contract development.
- **Market Manipulation** : Use of robust models to identify and react to manipulation attempts.

### Possible Improvements

- **Model Enhancement** : Continuous training with updated data to improve prediction accuracy.
- **User Interface** : Development of a user-friendly dashboard for monitoring and control.
- **Integration with More DEXs** : Expanding support to other decentralized exchanges for diversified trading opportunities.

## Tech Stack

- **Giza CLI & SDK** : For model training, ONNX conversion, transpilation and deployment.
- **Starknet Mainnet** : Blockchain platform for deploying and executing contracts.
- **yFinance** : Data source for fetching historical and real-time financial data.
